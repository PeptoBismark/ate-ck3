They believe that the true fate of mankind is decided not here on Earth, but far distant amongst the stars, where the true powers of the universe control everything, commonly believing that distant worlds host divine beings who, for good or bad, will set the fate of mankind, and contacting with them is the only way of reaching the truth and deciding their own fate."

As people strayed from following the Celestial Instructions a cosmic punishment was brought forth. Only through observation and following of the Instructions, can mankind discover the truth of Master Nibiru, and the Elder Siblings, or Annunaki, wise all-powerful gods that live far amongst the stars as part of an Universal Brotherhood. They also believe in the practices of creating and maintaining glyphs, colossal messages written in the land, so the Elder Siblings can read them back and bring blessings to those who walk the star path. Adherents are known to spend years crossing the land to reach the great observatories, holy altars distant in the mountains where the original followers of the path contacted the Elder Siblings before the Event."

Zetanologists are convinced that the Zetans have tried to warn humans of the great recycling by showing themselves in their astral vehicles, by abducting destined individuals, even writing to us in the form of crop fields but these warnings were all ignored. By following the traditions set by the Zetans, adherents align themselves spiritually with their masters from beyond Earth. Only the spiritually aligned will be allowed access to the next world once their soul leaves their body. Zetanologists believe that the devout followers will be saved by a great astral ship at the start of the next great recycling."
