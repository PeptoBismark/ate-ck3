 catholic_desc:0 "Catholicism is one of the oldest branches of Christianity, and it survived the cataclysmic events of centuries past by the skin of its teeth. After the Deluge, the surviving Catholic hierarchy in America received word of a divine apparition that confirmed the destruction of the Papacy in Rome and gave the surviving American cardinals the right to elect a new Bishop of Rome from their number. The new American Popes lacked a permanent temporal seat for centuries - a period known as "the Wandering Papacy" - until control over the old city of St. Louis in Missouri was finally established in the late 24th century. Because of its association with the Papacy, St. Louis earned the nickname "New Rome", although this term is not officially used by the Catholic Church. The formal head of the religion is the Bishop of Rome - the Pope."

Neo-Gnostics have amalgamated the belief in the Christian God, who they call "The One" with the rejection of materialism often found in Harmonic schools of thought. They believe that Salvation can be found in worship of Christ and that they can find Enlightenment through his teachings. Gnostics see material posessions and desires as secondary to Oneness with God. They reject the material world as being the work of Satan and seek to embrace the 'Gnosis', or knowledge of God."

In need of greater unity and direction than ever, the archbishops of South America brought their political differences aside and decided to unite as a Particular Catholic Church, and elected the Patriarch of South America to lead them. Originally based in Buenos Aires, the rise of other faiths has displaced the Patriarchy to Santiago. While the Particularists have maintained their catholic latin rites, folk practices such as the veneration of shrines of the tragically departed have become part of the traditional rites, as well, and belief in the influences of the restless souls and their link to God permeates society."

 ursuline_adherent_plural:0 "Ursulines"
 ursuline_desc:0 "The Ursulines originated as an antediluvian religious order, patronized by Saint Ursula. After the Deluge, most Quebecois Catholics turned to the Ursuline Order for guidance. Although their outsized role in Quebecois religious life was initially tolerated by the Catholic Church, the entire order and all of its followers were excommunicated following an attempt by the Ursulines to elect one of their own to the Papacy. In response, the Ursuline Order formally split from the Catholic Church. The current position of the Ursulines is that none of the Christian bishops currently operating in the Americas have proper apostolic succession, and that members of sanctioned religious orders can serve as de facto clergy until bishop-level apostolic succession is re-established."

 charismaticism_adherent:0 "Neo-Charismatic"
 charismaticism_adherent_plural:0 "Neo-Charismatics"
 charismaticism_desc:0 "Neo-Charismatics are not known as such because of their charm, but rather their belief that 'charismata', gifts of the Holy Spirit manifested in miracles and signs, are still available to all believers simply by baptism and faith in the Holy Spirit. Considering themselves to carry the Third Wave of the Holy Spirit beyond traditional Charismatics and Pentecostals, they too, believe in the availability of gifts including the ability to speak in tongues, miraculous healing of the cripples, gifts of prophecy and more events often considered extraordinary, but they also desire a structural renewal where apostles and prophets will lead the church to the Kingdom of God. This radical push for an Apostolic Renewal against the hierarchy of the Evangelical Convention has lead them to declare these beliefs heretical, but the Neo-Charismatic faith continues to thrive outside the jurisdiction of the Holy Columbian Confederacy."

While originally part of the South American Evangelical Convention conformed by other groups, the Neo-Pentecostals rose to lead the Convention, and casted all the other denominations who denied their Apostolic Renewal as heretics."

 anglican_desc:0 "Anglicanism describes itself as being a 'via media', or middle way, between Evangelical Protestantism and the Catholic Church. Following the Deluge, the Anglican Church in Canada refused to participate in the Evangelical Convention called by the churches in the Deep South, becoming recognized as a separate faith unto itself. It quickly became widespread in the former Anglophone provinces of Canada, as its pluralistic teachings and tolerance for both Protestant and Catholic practices made it attractive to Canadians from all backgrounds. The highest authority in Anglicanism is the Archbishop of New Canterbury."

Followers of Batenburgism believe that the invasion was a sign that the doctrine of pacifism was to be abandoned entirely, rather than being merely relaxed.

Instead, the various archdioceses began to administer the church according to their local authority an Insula, or island community, with their own rites. These rites, amounting to almost full canons, contain both functional law and local saints. Although they theoretically are pending approval by the Pope in Rome, they are treated as valid in his absence. Most lay practitioners trust that their bishops do their due diligence and consider their local traditions to be in line with mainstream Catholicism. Other Catholics would note that many Insular Christians venerate 'African saints' that are suspiciously similar to figures from other nearby religions."

This star was a fallen Angel who had sacrificed themselves to save mankind from God's wrath, explaining humanity's survival. 'Starmen' are generally viewed with suspicion by some with more traditional Christian beliefs, as the concept of Fallen Angels is generally associated with Satan. However, the Starmen insist their angel has little in common with the fallen Angel Lucifer, and that their angel's compassion reawakened God's mercy in a moment of anger. Thus, the Church of the Falling Star is still normatively Christian, albeit with a liturgy that features great devotion to their fallen 'star'."

 mormon_desc:0 "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is a faith with its roots in the Midwest of Old America, based on the teachings of Joseph Smith, its founder and first prophet. When he was 12, Smith saw a vision of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, who told him that all churches taught false doctrines and that the restoration of the gospel and the original church was soon to come. Later in life he recieved a series of visits from the Angel Moroni, an ancient Native American prophet. These culminated in his recieving of gold plates, which held the Book of Mormon, a record of the ancient Nephite and Lamanite civilizations, groups decended from Jews who were taken to the American continent by the Lord, and visited by Christ after his death. Following the assassination of Joseph Smith and his presumed heir, Hyrum Smith, in 1844, Brigham Young came out from the succession crisis the dominant leader, arguing the seniormost apostle was to become the next Prophet. Under his leadership, the controversial practice of polygamy was expanded, and the Mormons moved west, to Utah, and thrived in isolation. Political conflicts would see polygamy ended as a practice, however, and social changes led to the practice being looked down on by church members themselves. Unusual doctrines, such as belief that the Godhead is composed of not just three persons, but three distinct entities, belief in a continuing line of prophets, and practicing "bapisms for the dead" for those who never had an LDS baptism, have led to Mormonism being seen as distint from its Nicene cousins."

 community_of_christ_desc:0 "The Community of Christ, sometimes called the Reorganites, are an LDS sect that have their origin in the "reorganization" of Joseph Smith Jr.'s church under his son, Joseph Smith III -- 11 years old at the time of his father's death, Joseph Smith III would not assume the presidency until 16 years afterward, in 1860. The Community of Christ, while maintaining a number of distinct LDS practices, like prophetic revelation and use of the Book of Mormon, other doctrines such as a Trinitarian Godhead and salvation by grace alone result in a more Protestant-like belief system. This balance between LDS roots and Nicene doctrines has been well-struck, and the CoC has friends among both groups -- aided by a very early rejection of polygamy. A very strong emphasis on achieving earthly peace, ordination of women to the priesthood, and a long-standing tradition of prophetood being inherited by the Smith family are all notable practices that make the CoC distinct within the LDS movement."
