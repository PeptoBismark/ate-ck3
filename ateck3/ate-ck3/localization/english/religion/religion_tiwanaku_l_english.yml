As the source of life and the world we live in, mother of the Sun and the Moon and everything that is, Pachamamists believe in the Pacha Mama as the head of a wide array of telluric spirits of the Andes, and thus we must give offerings back to the World Mother in gratitude for everything she has given us, and caring for nature is caring for the gifts of the Goddess herself, thus protection of the land and living in harmony with it is the primordial duty of each person."
