 scientific_religion_desc:1 "Scientists believe in the vast world of Atomos, an invisible domain that governs the very fundimentals of reality. To them, Atomos is the ultimate granter-and-taker; destruction and creation being but two sides of the same coin, as he brings all to their final resting place at the end of their half lives. Nominated alongside him are his holy warriors, the Elements, who stand guard and carry out his tasks manifested in the visible world around us."

Atomicists believe in a ritual called 'the blessing of the atom', in which they call Atomos upon their newborns in the form of his many emanations, Plutonis, Uranus, or Radia. By harnessing the hidden world of Atomos, an Atomicist may achieve enlightenment and may discover the truths of the world we live in."

Whilst possessing a hierarchical church structure that is said to have stemmed 'from the Old World itself', Aphites are known for their increased zeal and societal strictness in adhering to their plan. They are known to view Atomos's aspects as gods, omitting the radiant figures of Radia, Plutonis, and Uranus from the Pantheon in favor of Plumbus and Graphis."
