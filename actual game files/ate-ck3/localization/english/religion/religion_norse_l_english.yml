 viking_desc:0 "The Norse believe that the time of the Old Gods has come again. Most of humanity perished in the darkness of Ragnarok, along with the false gods of ancient America and many of the Aesir, including Odin and Thor. Thor sacrificed himself to protect the last of humanity, but in a miracle of miracles he rose from the dead, ending Ragnarok. Thor now leads the surviving gods in the post-Ragnarok age. However, the dead gods are not truly gone - their restless spirits sometimes return to roam the earth alongside man. The followers of the Thunderer will be protected from the dead gods, just as they were protected during Ragnarok."
