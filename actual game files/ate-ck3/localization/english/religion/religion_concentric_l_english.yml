 earthvault_desc:0 "Before the event and before any memory, Svalbard has always been isolated and life has always been difficult. The people request help from the nissar of their ships and homes, and from Sankte Niklas, the nisseking and giver of gifts. But these powers aren't available everywhere, and the further out an Earthvaulter ventures, the greater the danger they have to be wary of. The Earthvaulters perceive the world in concentric levels. Each person's center is their own homes, dug in ancient mineshaft, vaults, and other subterranean places. These are the provinces of ordinary folks and of the each one has nissar that help keep things in order in exchange for food in annual feasts. These places are within the islands, which are the province of the beasts of the land and eternally surveyed by the two glass eyes of the Vaultkeeper. The islands lie within the sea, where the only nissar are those on the ships, and where Havfruen and Kraken hold equal sway. Beyond the sea lie other lands filled with foreigners and even worse. The further out a creature is, the more strange and hostile; the closer in, the more heinous it would be to harm it."
