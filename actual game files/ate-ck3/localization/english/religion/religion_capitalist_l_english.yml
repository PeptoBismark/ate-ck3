 capitalist_religion_desc:1 "Capitalists believe that the prosperity of the Old World was created and sustained through the operation of the Free Market in its many forms, with the Almighty Dollar being the most pervasive of these manifestations. By engaging in the ritual of Shopping and collecting the Dollar's symbols, one could accumulate Capital, which in turn would sustain the Free Market and humanity as a whole. Unfortunately, mankind eventually stopped collecting Capital, starving the Free Market. Mankind was punished for this sin by having its prosperity erased, condemning everyone to pain and misery. By reviving the ritual of Shopping and collecting the Dollar's remaining symbols, Capitalists seek to inject new Capital into the Free Market, recreating the Old World's prosperity."

 consumerist_desc:0 "Consumerists believe that Capital can only be conveyed to the Free Market via the ritual of Shopping, and that accumulating symbols of the Dollar is simply a means to achieve this end. Consumerist Shopping rituals are highly extravagant, and achieve the dual goals of relieving earthly stress and injecting Capital into the Market. Consumerists respect those who conspicuously display and spend their wealth, as these acts provide the Market with an abundance of Capital."

 monetarist_desc:0 "Monetarists believe that Capital can be conveyed to the Free Market simply by accumulating the Dollar's symbols, as their energy will 'trickle down' into the Free Market over time. Monetarists therefore place much less significance on Shopping, believing that the true goal of the ritual is to achieve an equilibrium between spending and saving. Monetarists respect those who use all available means to accumulate Capital, as this shows a strong devotion to the Free Market."
