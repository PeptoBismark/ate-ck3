 vernacular_religion_religion_desc:1 "The Vernacular faiths emerged after the Fall, when the chain of knowledge and wisdom from the past was broken. Misconceptions and misunderstandings became articles of faith, and rituals that once incorporated metaphor took on very literal meanings. Over time, these 'vernacular' practices became all but unrecognizable, forming a new religion unto itself."

 revelationist_desc:0 "Revelationism's origins are ultimately Christian in nature. The trauma of the apocalypse and centuries of isolation and turmoil have lead to great distortions in the faith, emphasizing the supernatural and miraculous while forgetting the Holy Trinity altogether, replacing it with a vast and sometimes inconsistent pantheon of gods. One of the most prominent Revelationist deities is the "Serpentine God", who often manifests his will using living snakes. This fascination with snakes has caused most mainline Christians to view Revelationism with deep suspicion at best and ouright hostility at worst." #copied from CK2

 tenet_serpentine_strength_desc:0 "Our gods demand that our faith be tested frequently through the ancient practice of snake handling. The faith this practice engenders strengthens our bonds with each other and steels our nerves against outsiders."
