 revivalist_desc:1 "Whilst much of the Ummah saw the Event as a test by God, the Revivalist sect saw it in a very different light. The Event was no test-- it was a reckoning, a punishment from God for the sins of society. Ostracized from the Traditionalist community, the Revivalists believed the only way to "revive" society and lift God's punishment was to cleanse sin and heresy from this world."

 imamite_desc:2 "efusing to abandon the world around them in the wake of the event, the Imamites held onto their beliefs while also adapting to become a cosmopolitan faith. Unlike Traditionalists who focus inwards to preserve themselves, Imamites strive to build a place for themselves amongst the outside world, instead of isolating themselves from it for safety. The Imamites are guided by the Supreme Islamic Majlis, and are named Imamites because of the leader of the Majlis, the (head) Imam. They await Imam Mahdi's coming, and the corresponding deliverance of freedom and justice."

 alawiyya_desc:0 "ather than adopt the cosmopolitan attitude of the Imamites, the 'Alawiyya community adheres to a fundamentalist version of Imamite theology. Like the Imamites, they also highly respect the post-event figure of Zakariyya, but they emphasize his martial exploits rather than his diplomatic ones. The 'Alawiyya are thus more warlike than mainstream Imamites and reject cosmopolitanism out of hand."

 qingzhen_adherent_plural:0 "Qingzhens"
 qingzhen_desc:0 "The Qingzhenren, literally meaning 'Pure True People', have existed since pre-event times. When Zakariyya I briefly conquered San Fransisco, some within the Chino community in the city adopted his philosophy, leading to a reawakening of Qingzhen thought. They have historically been heavily repressed by the rulers in San Fransisco, though they found some reprieve under the Yudkow dynasty. The Qingzhen view themselves as following the "four dao" - the four ways - which were taught by the sages Kong Fuzi (Confucius), Laozi, Buddha and Muzheng (Muhammad). Some non-Islamic theological influence comes from these teachings, such as an emphasis on respecting Heaven's Mandate, as ordered by Allah, as well as reverence of saintly figures, which lead to others claiming that they are idolatrous in nature. One standout belief is that polygamy, while permitted, is dissuaded. They are cosmopolitan like the mainstream Imamites."

Orientalists try to incorporate the ancient rites of their order and legends from the old world into their religious practices, which many non-Orientalists decry as "distortions" in the faith. The Orientalist religious heirarchy answers to a high priest known as the Grand Sultan."

Instead, they believe that the 'Great Calamity' fell on the Americas because mankind deviated from the true Islamic message, which 'Amun-Allah' gave to the people of Earth through a series of Moorish prophets. Misrists believe that rulers can be revered after death, and they often take traditional Egyptian names."
