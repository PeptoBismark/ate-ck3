 catholic_adherent_plural:0 "Conclavians"
 catholic_desc:0 "Catholicism in America survived the cataclysmic events of centuries past by the skin of its teeth. After the Deluge, the surviving Catholic hierarchy in America received word of a divine apparition that confirmed the destruction of the Papacy in Rome and gave the surviving American cardinals the right to hold a papal conclave and elect a new Bishop of Rome from their numbers. The new American Popes lacked a permanent temporal seat for centuries - a period known as "the Wandering Papacy" - until control over the old city of St. Louis in Missouri was finally established in the late 24th century. Because of its association with the Papacy, St. Louis earned the nickname "New Rome", although this term is not officially used by the Church. The formal head of the religion is the Bishop of Rome - the Pope. As other Catholic groups across the continent have rejected the authority of the St. Louis Papacy, many have come to refer to them as Conclavian, for their continued use of papal conclaves to elect what they consider the righteous Vicar of Christ."

Neo-Gnostics have amalgamated the belief in the Christian God, who they call "The One", with the rejection of materialism often found in Harmonic schools of thought. They believe that salvation can be found in worship of Christ and that they can find enlightenment through his teachings.

 particularist_desc:0 "Particularists are heirs from the once by far dominant faith of the continent, Catholicism, which was battered by the chaos and the change brought by the Event. In need of greater unity and direction than ever, an union of archbishops of South America put their political differences aside and decided to unite as a sui iuris particular Catholic Church, and elected the Patriarch of South America to lead them. Originally based in Buenos Aires, the rise of other faiths has displaced the Patriarchy north of the Paraná, to Asunción. While the Particularists have maintained their Catholic Latin rites, traditional folk practices of the River Plate Basin have deeply permeated it. The autonomous ecclesiastical leadership has sanctioned many of its venerated local saints as canonical, as well as the devotions to Gauchito Gil, San La Muerte, and San Roque Gonzalez de Santa Cruz."

 animism_adj:0 "Animist"
 animism_adherent:0 "Animist"
 animism_adherent_plural:0 "Animists"
 animism_desc:0 "The Animist Catholic Church is, as the name implies, descended from antediluvian Catholicism. While the Animists have maintained their Catholic Latin rites, folk practices such as veneration of the souls, or “Ánimas”, of the tragically departed have become part of the traditional rites as well. This was done chiefly through the construction and maintenance of “Ánimitas”, small shrines they use to remember and venerate these souls. The devout reverence for these souls gave Animists their name, as they believe that the souls, with their lives unfulfilled, serve as a bridge between the mortal and the divine, enabling them to intercede in the name of the faithful and cause miracles. While most shrines are dedicated to local souls, some Ánimas have gained large followings, being regarded as saintly, hallowed spirits that are willing to help the faithful far across the land. Among these are La Difunta Correa, San Balmaceda, and Ceferino Namuncurá. The Animists were originally in communion with the Patriarch in Asunción, but as the Particularist states kept pushing for further power, the western South American churches left communion to establish their own autonomous patriarchs, lead as equals by the Ecumenical Patriarch in Santiago."

 ursuline_adherent_plural:0 "Ursulines"
 ursuline_desc:0 "The Ursulines originated as an antediluvian religious order, patronized by Saint Ursula. After the Deluge, most Quebecois Catholics turned to the Ursuline Order for guidance. Although their outsized role in Quebecois religious life was initially tolerated by the Conclavian Catholics they were in communion with, the entire order and all of its followers were excommunicated following an attempt by the Ursulines to elect one of their own to the Papacy. In response, the Ursuline Order formally split from the Conclavians and established its own Catholic Church. The current position of the Ursulines is that none of the Christian bishops currently operating in the Americas have proper apostolic succession, and that members of sanctioned religious orders can serve as de facto clergy until bishop-level apostolic succession is re-established."

 charismaticism_adherent:0 "Neo-Charismatic"
 charismaticism_adherent_plural:0 "Neo-Charismatics"
 charismaticism_desc:0 "Neo-Charismatics are not known as such because of their charm, but rather their belief that 'charismata', gifts of the Holy Spirit manifested in miracles and signs, are still available to all believers simply by baptism and faith in the Holy Spirit. Considering themselves to carry the Third Wave of the Holy Spirit beyond traditional Charismatics and Pentecostals, they too, believe in the availability of gifts including the ability to speak in tongues, miraculous healing of the cripples, gifts of prophecy and more events often considered extraordinary, but they also desire a structural renewal where apostles and prophets will lead the church to the Kingdom of God. This radical push for an Apostolic Renewal against the hierarchy of the Evangelical Convention has lead them to declare these beliefs heretical, but the Neo-Charismatic faith continues to thrive outside the jurisdiction of the Holy Columbian Confederacy."

 anglican_adherent_plural:0 "Anglicans"
 anglican_desc:0 "Anglicanism describes itself as being a 'via media', or middle way, between Evangelical Protestantism and the Catholic Church. After the Deluge, the Anglican Church in Canada refused to participate in the Evangelical Convention called by the churches in the Deep South, becoming recognized as a separate faith unto itself. It quickly became widespread in the former Anglophone provinces of Canada, as its pluralistic teachings and tolerance for both Protestant and Catholic practices made it attractive to Canadians from all backgrounds. The highest authority in Anglicanism is the Archbishop of New Canterbury."

Anabaptists believe Christians should remain separate from the rest of the world, refuse to hold office, and refrain from violence except when absolutely necessary.

Followers of Batenburgism believe that the invasion was a sign that the doctrine of pacifism was to be abandoned entirely, rather than being merely relaxed. Followers of other Christian faiths condemn these heretics for their maintenence of harems and their tendency to violently raid the homes of non-believers."

 insular_carribean_desc:1 "When contact with Rome was lost, the Catholics of the Caribbean mostly retained their faith and did not recognize a new head. Instead, the various archdioceses began to administer the church according to their local authority an Insula, or island community, with their own rites. These rites, amounting to almost full canons, contain both functional law and local saints. Although they theoretically are pending approval by the Pope in Rome, they are treated as valid in his absence. Most lay practitioners trust that their bishops do their due diligence and consider their local traditions to be in line with mainstream Catholicism. Other Catholics would note that many Insular Christians venerate 'African saints' that are suspiciously similar to figures from other nearby religions."

This star was a fallen Angel who had sacrificed themselves to save mankind from God's wrath, explaining humanity's survival. 'Starmen' are generally viewed with suspicion by some with more traditional Christian beliefs, as the concept of Fallen Angels is generally associated with Satan. However, the Starmen insist their angel has little in common with the fallen Angel Lucifer, and that their angel's compassion reawakened God's mercy in a moment of anger. Thus, the Church of the Falling Star is still normatively Christian, albeit with a liturgy that features great devotion to their fallen 'star'."

Classical Pentecostals share many principles, but are still close to most other protestants in matters of church and doctrine, to the point where their influence and contact has led other christians to embrace Continuationism and become “Charismatic”. After the event, Pentecostals banded together with other Protestants through the continent, but in South America, after the Neo-Pentecostals, divergent Charismatic fundamentalists, tried to subvert and take control of the Evangelical Convention, the Classical Pentecostals were cast aside from the Non-Conformist movement in distrust, and now the Pentecostals stand on their own, independent for now."

Originating from traditionalist Catholics who disagreed with the changes the church had been going through, the adherents of Tridentinism believe that the Event was a punishment, a divine retaliation to bring down those who lost sight of the Lord’s true path, and culminated in His Holiness, the Vicar of Christ, leaving the Earth with no successor behind.

Thus, only base church communities that are comprised of self-reliant worshipers from amongst the common people can return the church closer to the early uncorrupted gospel. Some of the more radical Liberationists believe that the plight of greed directly caused the Deluge, as society went Godless and the natural order was broken."

Under the leadership of the Episcopal Primacy, the fervent Mexican devotion to the Virgin of Guadalupe, Patroness of Mexico and Latin America, has became the norm. This has caused other Christian groups to refer to them as Guadalupans. Regardless, the so-called 'Guadalupans' say that they maintain the same tenets that they have followed for millennia. Traditional saints such as St. Jude and St. Benedict remain popular with Guadalupans, but the veneration of folk saints such as El Santo and St. Juan Soldado became accepted as part of the canon over time."

Although they still consider themselves faithful adherents of the Catholic Church in Mexico, they pay little attention to the common traditions of the Church, the Virgin of Guadalupe, and the other Mexican saints. Instead, the so-called 'Enmascarados' believe that fighting for justice against the wicked and defending the innocent and the weak is the most devout thing any Christian can do. Enmascarados don ceremonial masks and physically fight for justice, believing that El Santo and other martial saints such as St. George, Fray Tormenta and the Archangel Michael will bless them in these battles."

 santa_muerte_desc:0 "Some Mexican Catholics venerate Santa Muerte, also known as Our Lady of the Holy Death, as the holiest of all the saints and the most powerful of God’s servants. The personification of Death herself, her great power over life has made her widely venerated for protection and health. However, her believers believe that for every request for intercession, they must give something back to her in equal exchange. As death is just and equal amongst all, the followers of the Saintly Death belong to all corners of society, even those who are shunned by traditional Christian moralism. Santa Muertists consider mutual respect and tolerance to be one of their greatest tenets. Although they originated as part of the greater Catholic community in Mexico, the church authorities in Mexico City have rejected Santa Muerte and her followers, denouncing their 'worship' as wicked and idolatrous. In response to this declaration and the persecution that followed it, the Santa Muertists established their own church hierarchy, which they claim to be the righteous Catholic Church in opposition to the Guadalupans."

The Church retains many elements of traditional Protestant Christianity, believing that the Bible is God’s most direct revelation to humankind, and that Communion is a holy act. The Church is lead by a Moderator, who mediates disputes and may grant indulgences to the faithful."  "
