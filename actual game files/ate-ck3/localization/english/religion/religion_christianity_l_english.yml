 catholic_adherent_plural:0 "Conclavians"
 catholic_desc:0 "Catholicism in America survived the cataclysmic events of centuries past by the skin of its teeth. After the Deluge, the surviving Catholic hierarchy in America received word of a divine apparition that confirmed the destruction of the Papacy in Rome and gave the surviving American cardinals the right to hold a papal conclave and elect a new Bishop of Rome from their numbers. The new American Popes lacked a permanent temporal seat for centuries - a period known as "the Wandering Papacy" - until control over the old city of St. Louis in Missouri was finally established in the late 24th century. Because of its association with the Papacy, St. Louis earned the nickname "New Rome", although this term is not officially used by the Church. The formal head of the religion is the Bishop of Rome - the Pope. As other Catholic groups across the continent have rejected the authority of the American-elected Papacy, many have come to refer to them as Conclavian, for their upholding of papal conclaves to elect what they consider the righteous Vicar of Christ."

Neo-Gnostics have amalgamated the belief in the Christian God, who they call "The One" with the rejection of materialism often found in Harmonic schools of thought. They believe that Salvation can be found in worship of Christ and that they can find Enlightenment through his teachings.

In need of greater unity and direction than ever, the archbishops of South America brought their political differences aside and decided to unite as a Particular Catholic Church, and elected the Patriarch of South America to lead them. Originally based in Buenos Aires, the rise of other faiths has displaced the Patriarchy to Santiago. While the Particularists have maintained their catholic latin rites, folk practices such as the veneration of shrines of the tragically departed have become part of the traditional rites, as well, and belief in the influences of the restless souls and their link to God permeates society."

 ursuline_adherent_plural:0 "Ursulines"
 ursuline_desc:0 "The Ursulines originated as an antediluvian religious order, patronized by Saint Ursula. After the Deluge, most Quebecois Catholics turned to the Ursuline Order for guidance. Although their outsized role in Quebecois religious life was initially tolerated by the Conclavian Catholics they were in communion with, the entire order and all of its followers were excommunicated following an attempt by the Ursulines to elect one of their own to the Papacy. In response, the Ursuline Order formally split from the Conclavians and established its own Catholic Church. The current position of the Ursulines is that none of the Christian bishops currently operating in the Americas have proper apostolic succession, and that members of sanctioned religious orders can serve as de facto clergy until bishop-level apostolic succession is re-established."

 charismaticism_adherent_plural:0 "Neo-Charismatics"
 charismaticism_desc:0 "Neo-Charismatics are not known as such because of their charm, but rather their belief that 'charismata', gifts of the Holy Spirit manifested in miracles and signs, are still available to all believers simply by baptism and faith in the Holy Spirit. Considering themselves to carry the Third Wave of the Holy Spirit beyond traditional Charismatics and Pentecostals, they too, believe in the availability of gifts including the ability to speak in tongues, miraculous healing of the cripples, gifts of prophecy and more events often considered extraordinary, but they also desire a structural renewal where apostles and prophets will lead the church to the Kingdom of God. This radical push for an Apostolic Renewal against the hierarchy of the Evangelical Convention has lead them to declare these beliefs heretical, but the Neo-Charismatic faith continues to thrive outside the jurisdiction of the Holy Columbian Confederacy."

Following the Deluge, the Anglican Church in Canada refused to participate in the Evangelical Convention called by the churches in the Deep South, becoming recognized as a separate faith unto itself. It quickly became widespread in the former Anglophone provinces of Canada, as its pluralistic teachings and tolerance for both Protestant and Catholic practices made it attractive to Canadians from all backgrounds. The highest authority in Anglicanism is the Archbishop of New Canterbury."

Instead, the various archdioceses began to administer the church according to their local authority an Insula, or island community, with their own rites. These rites, amounting to almost full canons, contain both functional law and local saints. Although they theoretically are pending approval by the Pope in Rome, they are treated as valid in his absence. Most lay practitioners trust that their bishops do their due diligence and consider their local traditions to be in line with mainstream Catholicism. Other Catholics would note that many Insular Christians venerate 'African saints' that are suspiciously similar to figures from other nearby religions."

This star was a fallen Angel who had sacrificed themselves to save mankind from God's wrath, explaining humanity's survival. 'Starmen' are generally viewed with suspicion by some with more traditional Christian beliefs, as the concept of Fallen Angels is generally associated with Satan. However, the Starmen insist their angel has little in common with the fallen Angel Lucifer, and that their angel's compassion reawakened God's mercy in a moment of anger. Thus, the Church of the Falling Star is still normatively Christian, albeit with a liturgy that features great devotion to their fallen 'star'."

 mormon_desc:0 "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is a faith with its roots in the Midwest of Old America, based on the teachings of Joseph Smith, its founder and first prophet. When he was 12, Smith saw a vision of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, who told him that all churches taught false doctrines and that the restoration of the gospel and the original church was soon to come. Later in life he recieved a series of visits from the Angel Moroni, an ancient Native American prophet. These culminated in his recieving of gold plates, which held the Book of Mormon, a record of the ancient Nephite and Lamanite civilizations, groups decended from Jews who were taken to the American continent by the Lord, and visited by Christ after his death. Following the assassination of Joseph Smith and his presumed heir, Hyrum Smith, in 1844, Brigham Young came out from the succession crisis the dominant leader, arguing the seniormost apostle was to become the next Prophet. Under his leadership, the controversial practice of polygamy was expanded, and the Mormons moved west, to Utah, and thrived in isolation. Political conflicts would see polygamy ended as a practice, however, and social changes led to the practice being looked down on by church members themselves. Unusual doctrines, such as belief that the Godhead is composed of not just three persons, but three distinct entities, belief in a continuing line of prophets, and practicing "bapisms for the dead" for those who never had an LDS baptism, have led to Mormonism being seen as distint from its Nicene cousins."

The Community of Christ, while maintaining a number of distinct LDS practices, like prophetic revelation and use of the Book of Mormon, other doctrines such as a Trinitarian Godhead and salvation by grace alone result in a more Protestant-like belief system. This balance between LDS roots and Nicene doctrines has been well-struck, and the CoC has friends among both groups -- aided by a very early rejection of polygamy. A very strong emphasis on achieving earthly peace, ordination of women to the priesthood, and a long-standing tradition of prophetood being inherited by the Smith family are all notable practices that make the CoC distinct within the LDS movement."

Thus it's only through base church communities, where self-reliant worshipers from amongst the common people will return the church closer to the early uncorrupted gospel.

Muckers shun earthly values such as money, lust, drinking and smoking. Even though Muckers can pass sometimes as fanatics, they’re much less morally fundamentalist than their Celeste cousins, blessing each other with kisses, having an all-female clergy and having no shame in showing their bodies as God made them or expressing their love to each other."

Under the leadership the Episcopal Primacy, the fervent mexican devotion to the Virgin of Guadalupe, Patroness of Mexico and Latin America, has became the norm, causing different christian groups to refer to them as the Guadalupan, regardless, they claim to maintain the same tenets of the faith has they have for millennia. Under the leadership of the Primate, traditional saints such as St. Jude and St. Benedict remain popular, but the veneration of certain folk saints such as El Santo and St. Juan Soldado has become accepted as part of the canon with the centuries passed."

Although they still consider themselves faithful adherents of the Catholic Church in Mexico, they put little attention to the common traditions of the Church, the Virgin of Guadalupe, and the other Mexican Saints. Instead, wearing ceremonial masks, and asking El Santo for strength, the so-called Masked Catholics consider that fighting for justice against the wicked and defending the innocent and the weak is the most devout thing any christian can do, as they venerate the Silver Legend, El Santo, as the patron saint of justice, who will bless them in all their battles, along with other martial saints such as St. George, Fray Tormenta and the Archangel Michael."

The personification of death herself, her great power over life has made her widely venerated for protection and health, albeit her believers consider that for everything they ask, they must give something back in equal exchange. As death is just and equal amongst all, the followers of the Saintly Death tend to belong to all corners of society, even those rejected by traditional christian moralism, and consider mutual respect and tolerance as one of its greatest tenets. While originally born as another part of the greater Catholic world in Mexico, the church authorities in Mexico City have rejected Santa Muerte, denouncing it as wicked and idolatrous. With the weakening of religious authority in the chaos after the event, the faithful of Death, tired of the persecution, and considering themselves closer to the true ideals of catholic christianity, have established their own church hierarchy, claiming to be the righteous Catholic Church, in opposition to the Guadalupans."
