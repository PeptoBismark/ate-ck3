 meditate_on_the_marquess_decision_desc:0 "The Marquess of García was the mad prophet who predicted the arrival of The Event and the collapse of the golden age, as well as the second coming of a new Libertador destined to unify the Great Fatherland once again.

 ate_religious_decision.80.desc:0 "Devotion to the Fatherland is devotion to one's own mother, to duty, to all that is divine. The greatest among these devotees were the próceres, eternal heroes who still guide us with their example.\n\nEven so, it is clear that there are many ways to serve Fatherland, and many examples to follow among the heroes.

In them you can distinguish titles in a dead language that can be translated as "The Lonesome Century", "The Patriarch at fall" or "Romance of the Choleric Era".\n\nAs you inhale the portentous vapors of the sacred herbs you are taken into a trance in which you can listen to oblivion, smell destiny and savor the bitterest solitude. Only in this state the secret of the ancient pages will come to you."

 ate_religious_decision.90.t:0 "The lady of remedies"
 ate_religious.decision.90.desc:0 "You are a woman from the Cachaco lands wandering through the corridors a house built of broken old dreams, you can only see its walls covered with old time and drawings made of human excrement. You manage to stagger out of that labyrinth and reach the patio where the most beautiful woman in the world awaits you.\n\nAs she hangs clothes to dry you understand that her beauty is the only truth in the world. But before you can do anything she begins to ascend to the heavens. You cannot help but regret that she took with her the clothes she was hanging."
 ate_religious_decision.90.a:0 "Come back, I need you! I deserve you!"
 ate_religious_decision.90.b:0 "Go, this world is unworthy of you."
 ate_religious_decision.91.t:0 "The lonely wind"
 ate_religious.decision.91.desc:0 "You enter a room whose walls are older than time itself and filled with treasures of no value. On the shelves you find fish sculptures forged in gold, portraits with faces made of solitude and dresses woven with the mourning of a massacre committed in a banana field.\n\nAt the center of it all is a tome written in a language that is not men's but that you can still understand. It tells the story of your life and of all life, of your dynasty being eaten by ants, of an era that has already been and will not return. As your eyes go to the end of the story, you can feel how a hurricane has come to devour that eternal room, to destroy what has been since the beginning of time. The golden age is over."

 ate_religious_decision.91.b:0 "Not an end, I refuse it."
 ate_religious_decision.92.t:0 "The Patriarch’s Winter"
 ate_religious.decision.92.desc:0 "You are in the dining hall of an ancient palace, made of gold, blood and empty hope. Before you sits an old prócer, a patriarch who reigns in some corner of the Patria Grande during the golden age. You both understand, without having a reason for it, that one of you will die soon, him or you.\n\nOnly luck can make that decision, so the solution is to flip a coin. As the penny spins in the air, you realize that both sides of the coin are heads, and that the face is the same, the face of the old prócer, your face. The coin hits the ground."
 ate_religious_decision.92.a:0 "Heads, I will die in this golden age."
 ate_religious_decision.92.b:0 "Heads, I will outlive the golden age."
 ate_religious_decision.93.t:0 "The sea of no man"
 ate_religious.decision.93.desc:0 "You see the endless sea, where cannibals and reavers once battled each other. As its beauty consumes you a roar from the sky reverberates in your ears. An iron dragonfly has come to take the sea away, and on its back rides a perfidious priest of the northerner pagans, who has come to steal what little remains of the golden age.\n\nDesperate, you beg the próceres to stop the heathen, but they ignore you. You know then that the golden age has come to an end and the Patria Grande is lost."
 ate_religious_decision.93.a:0 "How can I feel nostalgic for a world that I never knew? "

 ate_religious_decision.94.t:0 "Carnivals of love"
 ate_religious_decision.94.desc:0 "You are a young man in the times of carnival at some walled city of the Costeño lands, some old capital where the old glories were substituted by absurdity. By your side is a woman of a wild beauty who has promised to teach you the arts of love. As you breathe in her papaya-flavored breath, the trance of your passions is broken when you see her draw the shine of a dagger.\n\nYou escape completely naked from that terror, only to end up in the middle of the carnival street. Your screams of horror and the lover turned murderer become an object of ridicule for the celebrants who think it is all part of the party."
 ate_religious_decision.94.a:0 "The consequences of the vices of the flesh."
 ate_religious_decision.94.b:0 "Love, violence, laughter, in the end it's all passion."
 ate_religious_decision.95.t:0 "The eternal ship"
 ate_religious.decision.95.desc:0 "You are an old woman on board a ship that plows through the waters of the oldest river in the world. While the waters smelling of nostalgia shake the boat, you see that you are accompanied by a man you loved half a century ago when your soul was still young and your flesh was tender.\n\nYou take his hand and bring it to your withered chest, you understand then that the ship in which you travel is eternal like the river and that as long as you remain in it, love will not die, the golden age will have no end. With that thought you surrender to the lips of memory."
 ate_religious_decision.95.a:0 "This is it, this is the answer."
 ate_religious_decision.95.b:0 "No, an illusion, all must end."
