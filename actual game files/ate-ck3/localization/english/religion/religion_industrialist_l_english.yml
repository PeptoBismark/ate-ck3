 industrialist_religion_desc:1 "Whereas some believe that holiness may be found in nature, others look upon the ruined works of mankind and see divinity revealed. The Industrialists believe that human construction connects with and reveals eternal powers and forces, and they revere the creator and product in equal measure. All Industrialist faiths are united by a credo of rediscovery and reproduction as they attempt to capture the energies, ideas, and regulations that allowed their ancestors to reach new heights of knowledge and fulfillment. Whether it is delving through forgotten ruins for the fabled Standard Measure or debating the purpose of strange and obscure artifacts, Industrialists are constantly laboring to honor and maintain the ingenious spiritual understanding of the generations that came before."

 galvanist_desc:0 "Galvanists believe that the wedding of the Titans' vision with the Workers' steady labor created the Forces of Industry, the driving engine of mankind's Golden Age. By building incredible infrastructure and innovative products, the Forces of Industry were able to improve the world in both a material and spiritual sense. However, this was not to last - conflict between the Titans and the Workers led to the destruction of the Forces and the 'Great Rust' - the destruction and decay of all the great works of Man. Galvanists seek to undo the Great Rust by rallying around the ancient Factories and rediscovering the secrets of the Titans."

According to Adnates, the true goal of the Forces was to incorporate the greatest Industrial works into the human body, elevating mankind to heights that are impossible to fathom. However, a group of savage Luddites brought the Forces' noble project to a premature end by destroying as many Industrial works as they could, leading to the Great Rust. Adnates have since taken it upon themselves to complete the Forces' vision, both by trying to understand how it could be done and by attemping it themselves."
