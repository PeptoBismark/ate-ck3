 masonic_desc:0 "Occultists believe in the existence of unfathomably powerful divinity, which is distant from the world – and must stay that way, lest great peril befall humanity. What less than the divine could cause the event? Therefore the Masons help maintain and reinforce the foundations of human society, despite its comparative insignificance through ancient mysticisms. Their rituals and egregores stave off attention from those beyond the stars, but equally importantly they police the behavior of the people to prevent witchcraft, for the slightest mistake could invite terrible calamity."
