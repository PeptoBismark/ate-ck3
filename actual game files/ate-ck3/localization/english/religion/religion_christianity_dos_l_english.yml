 mormon_desc:0 "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is a faith with its roots in the Midwest of Old America, based on the teachings of Joseph Smith, its founder and first prophet. When he was 12, Smith saw a vision of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, who told him that all churches taught false doctrines and that the restoration of the gospel and the original church was soon to come. Later in life he recieved a series of visits from the Angel Moroni, an ancient Native American prophet. These culminated in his recieving of gold plates, which held the Book of Mormon, a record of the ancient Nephite and Lamanite civilizations, groups decended from Jews who were taken to the American continent by the Lord, and visited by Christ after his death. Following the assassination of Joseph Smith and his presumed heir, Hyrum Smith, in 1844, Brigham Young came out from the succession crisis the dominant leader, arguing the seniormost apostle was to become the next Prophet. Under his leadership, the controversial practice of polygamy was expanded, and the Mormons moved west, to Utah, and thrived in isolation. Political conflicts would see polygamy ended as a practice, however, and social changes led to the practice being looked down on by church members themselves. Unusual doctrines, such as belief that the Godhead is composed of not just three persons, but three distinct entities, belief in a continuing line of prophets, and practicing "bapisms for the dead" for those who never had an LDS baptism, have led to Mormonism being seen as distint from its Nicene cousins."

 community_of_christ_adj:0 "Reorganite"
 community_of_christ_adherent:0 "Reorganite"
 community_of_christ_adherent_plural:0 "Reorganites"
 community_of_christ_desc:0 "The Community of Christ, sometimes called the Reorganites, are an LDS sect that have their origin in the "reorganization" of Joseph Smith Jr.'s church under his son, Joseph Smith III -- 11 years old at the time of his father's death, Joseph Smith III would not assume the presidency until 16 years afterward, in 1860. The Community of Christ, while maintaining a number of distinct LDS practices, like prophetic revelation and use of the Book of Mormon, other doctrines such as a Trinitarian Godhead and salvation by grace alone result in a more Protestant-like belief system. This balance between LDS roots and Nicene doctrines has been well-struck, and the CoC has friends among both groups -- aided by a very early rejection of polygamy. A very strong emphasis on achieving earthly peace, ordination of women to the priesthood, and a long-standing tradition of prophetood being inherited by the Smith family are all notable practices that make the CoC distinct within the LDS movement."

 woolleyite_desc:0 "The Woolleyites split from mainstream Mormonism in the early 20th century after polygamy was officially banned by the Church. Led by Lorin Woolley, the 'Woolleyites', as they are known after the Event, stubbornly continue to practice polygamy to this day. Mainstream Mormonism considers plural marriages to be heretical, and will excommunicate anyone who is found to be part of one."

Strangites allow the ordination of women into the priesthood and reject the notion of the Trinity (believing that there is only one God, and that Jesus was born an ordinary mortal). Animal sacrifice is common, and devout farmers make an offering of the 'Firstfruit' of the harvest."

 neogodbeite_desc:0 "Neo-Godbeites are a relatively new movement in the Latter-Day Saints community. Originating after the Event, members of these groups drew on influences from both Pacific philosophy and heterodox pre-Event Mormon groups to inform their religious practices. Neo-Godbeites believe that women are capable of leading communities despite lacking access to the priesthood, and often emphasize the mystical and spiritual aspects of faith. They also reject the theodemocratic system, adhering instead to more secular forms of government." #???
