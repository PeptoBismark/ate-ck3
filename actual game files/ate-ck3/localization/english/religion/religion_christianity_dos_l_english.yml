 mormon_desc:0 "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is a faith with its roots in the Midwest of Old America, based on the teachings of Joseph Smith, its founder and first prophet. When he was 12, Smith saw a vision of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, who told him that all churches taught false doctrines and that the restoration of the gospel and the original church was soon to come. Later in life he recieved a series of visits from the Angel Moroni, an ancient Native American prophet. These culminated in his recieving of gold plates, which held the Book of Mormon, a record of the ancient Nephite and Lamanite civilizations, groups decended from Jews who were taken to the American continent by the Lord, and visited by Christ after his death. Attracting both a following and great controversy from his claims of divine revelation and recieving of new scripture, Smith's sect was forced to relocate multiple times. Following the assassination of Joseph Smith and his presumed heir, Hyrum Smith, in 1844, Brigham Young came out from the succession crisis the dominant leader, arguing the seniormost apostle was to become the next Prophet. Under his leadership, the controversial practice of polygamy was expanded, and the Mormons moved west, to Utah, and thrived in isolation. Political conflicts would see polygamy ended as a practice, however, and social changes led to the practice being looked down on by church members themselves. Unusual doctrines, such as belief that the Godhead is composed of not just three persons, but three distinct entities, belief in a continuing line of prophets, and practicing 'bapisms for the dead' for those who never had an LDS baptism, have led to Mormonism being seen as distint from its Nicene cousins."

 community_of_christ_adherent_plural:0 "Reorganites"
 community_of_christ_desc:0 "The Community of Christ, sometimes called the Reorganites, are an LDS sect that have their origin in the "reorganization" of Joseph Smith Jr.'s church under his son, Joseph Smith III -- 11 years old at the time of his father's death, Joseph Smith III would not assume the presidency until 16 years afterward, in 1860. The Community of Christ, while maintaining a number of distinct LDS practices, like prophetic revelation and use of the Book of Mormon, other doctrines such as a Trinitarian Godhead and salvation by grace alone result in a more Protestant-like belief system. This balance between LDS roots and Nicene doctrines has been well-struck, and the CoC has friends among both groups -- aided by a very early rejection of polygamy. A very strong emphasis on achieving earthly peace, ordination of women to the priesthood, and a long-standing tradition of prophetood being inherited by the Smith family are all notable practices that make the CoC distinct within the LDS movement."

 woolleyite_desc:0 "The Woolleyites are a Mormon sect that share a history with the LDS church of Brigham Young, up until the formal rejection of polygamy by the prophets Wilford Woodruff and Joseph F. Smith. John W. Woolley and his son, Lorin C Woolley, among others, believed that was evidence that the LDS church had rejected the eternal law of God by caving to political pressure, and claimed that Woodruff's predecessor, John Taylor, had ordained them apostles and charged them with preserving the true church. Woolleyites also claim, as doctrines and practices that were wrongly abandoned, the United Order, a communalistic program based on Joseph Smith's "law of consecration" of personal property to the church's ends, and the Adam-God doctrine, which alleges that Adam was the Father in the flesh much as Jesus Christ was the Son in the flesh. Unique among LDS splinters, the Woolleyites view their parent church as a legitimate organization -- simply mislead and distorted -- and await their return to the proper fold."

 strangite_adherent_plural:0 "Strangites"
 strangite_desc:0 "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is an LDS sect claiming descent from the prophethood of James Strang, who alleged that prophetic succession from Joseph Smith required divine appointment, which he had recieved from an angel. As "King" of his church, Strang introduced further scripture, claiming to translate a small set of plates created by the ancient American king Rajah Manchou of Voree, and the Book of the Law of the Lord, a document proporting to record part of the law given to Moses and preseved in the sealed portion of the golden plates. Strangites are adoptionist, believing that Jesus was born to mortal parents but perordained to be the Savior and adopted as God's son at birth. Animal sacrifice is practiced as part of religious festivities, and polygamy is sustained as valid. The death of Strang and his lack of a successor left the Strangites leaderless and doomed to relative obscurity. The sect no longer actively proselytizes, believing the dispensation of the gospel to have closed with Strang's death, but they still accept those souls who will come to them."

 neogodbeite_adherent_plural:0 "Neo-Godbeites"
 neogodbeite_desc:0 "The Neo-Godbeites, so named after a long extinct and nearly forgotten sect of mystics and political dissidents from the time of Brigham Young, share little with the historic Godbe other than his penchant for mysticism. Taking significant influences from the Gaians, and lesser influences from Native American and folk practices, the Neo-Godbeites place a significant influence on personal revelation, believing it to trump all other sources of revelation, including supposed prophets -- of whom, only Joseph Smith is revered, in his role as revelator and restorer of the Gospel. A deep respect of God's physical creation, and a special reverence of mountains as temples of God, is accompanied by a belief that women as well as men can exercise priesthood power, if not hold the keys themselves -- seen as little more than a formality by this sect. This sect is not organized, and adherents reject efforts to organize the faith or wed it to political structures."

 bickertonite_desc:0 "The Church of Jesus Christ, as they call themselves, are an LDS sect who believe that Sydney Rigdon, as Joseph Smith's first councilor, was the proper successor to the presidency of the church after his death. William Bickerton reorganized the church after the original Rigdonite church collapsed. Unlike other LDS denominations, Bickertonites do not view Joseph Smith as a prophet -- only as translator of the Book of Mormon and president of the church -- and so reject all revelations and personal writings made by Joseph Smith as false, including the ever-controversial practice of polygamy. Also unique to the Bickertonites is a belief that the Holy Spirit is not a person -- it is, rather, the mind of the Father and the Son, who are two distinct being with a united spirit and purpose, as in the more mainstream LDS faith in the west."
