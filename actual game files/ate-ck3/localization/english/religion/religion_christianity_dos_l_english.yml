 mormon_desc:0 "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is a faith with its roots in the Midwest of Old America, based on the teachings of Joseph Smith, its founder and first prophet. When he was 12, Smith saw a vision of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, who told him that all churches taught false doctrines and that the restoration of the gospel and the original church was soon to come. Later in life he recieved a series of visits from the Angel Moroni, an ancient Native American prophet. These culminated in his recieving of gold plates, which held the Book of Mormon, a record of the ancient Nephite and Lamanite civilizations, groups decended from Jews who were taken to the American continent by the Lord, and visited by Christ after his death. Following the assassination of Joseph Smith and his presumed heir, Hyrum Smith, in 1844, Brigham Young came out from the succession crisis the dominant leader, arguing the seniormost apostle was to become the next Prophet. Under his leadership, the controversial practice of polygamy was expanded, and the Mormons moved west, to Utah, and thrived in isolation. Political conflicts would see polygamy ended as a practice, however, and social changes led to the practice being looked down on by church members themselves. Unusual doctrines, such as belief that the Godhead is composed of not just three persons, but three distinct entities, belief in a continuing line of prophets, and practicing "bapisms for the dead" for those who never had an LDS baptism, have led to Mormonism being seen as distint from its Nicene cousins."

 community_of_christ_adherent_plural:0 "Reorganites"
 community_of_christ_desc:0 "The Community of Christ, sometimes called the Reorganites, are an LDS sect that have their origin in the "reorganization" of Joseph Smith Jr.'s church under his son, Joseph Smith III -- 11 years old at the time of his father's death, Joseph Smith III would not assume the presidency until 16 years afterward, in 1860. The Community of Christ, while maintaining a number of distinct LDS practices, like prophetic revelation and use of the Book of Mormon, other doctrines such as a Trinitarian Godhead and salvation by grace alone result in a more Protestant-like belief system. This balance between LDS roots and Nicene doctrines has been well-struck, and the CoC has friends among both groups -- aided by a very early rejection of polygamy. A very strong emphasis on achieving earthly peace, ordination of women to the priesthood, and a long-standing tradition of prophetood being inherited by the Smith family are all notable practices that make the CoC distinct within the LDS movement."
