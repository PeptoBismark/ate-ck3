 game_concept_lore_almighty_spirit_desc:0 "Highest of all the gods is the Almighty, The Great Spirit of the West. Older than all the others by a country mile, the Almighty was there when the horizons had no sun and the World was entirely mountains. In this time, he had his most ancient form, that of the Buffalo God; in these days he trampled the mountains to create the expanses of the prairies. As such, the Almighty and the land are tied together. He senses the changes and happenings of the earth, and longs ever after for the wide open expanses. Bison and maize are sacred to him. The shamans say that the sites holiest with the Almighty's power are those remote places far removed from the works of men. Alone in the land, at the lowering twilight, they say the presence of the Spirit of the West is the most clear."

Though his sphere is oft considered foreboding and his manner is dark, he is lawful, just, and heroic, and many tales are told of salvation he brought at the most desperate of times. Trailwalkers often extend courtesy to wanderers and strangers - both to walk upon generous and honest trails, and because one never knows when they may meet the Nameless incognito. "

 game_concept_lore_iron_horse_desc:0 "Iron Horse is one of the primordial gods. He is the god of endeavor and labor, not to mention the creator of horses. It is said of Iron Horse that his muscles are so huge they look like metal wheels, and his tendons so mighty they are like shafts of steel. Within his chest beats a brazen heart of heat and light; his breath billows black and white steam across the sky of the Frontier. Iron Horse carries a shield which can displace any obstacle, no matter how immovable; as such, Trailwalkers pray to him for help in overcoming many different struggles \n \n Long a friend of the Leadcasters for their similar love of effort and creation, Iron Horse is wed to the goddess Lockwood, who guards the Ghost Country and is sister to the Peacemaker. The fruit of their love is their son the Colt. \n \n Iron Horse's achievements are not merely physical, but spiritual as well: he is the one who lays the [lore_iron_trails|E], the immovable paths that are the greatest of all [lore_trails|E]."

 game_concept_lore_trails_desc:0 "Trails are that which the Trailwalker religion is named for: lines of destiny and purpose that connect and define all things. They are tied indelibly to the Frontier, and connect the fates of men to the magic of that realm. Some Trails can be chosen, some cannot; and in time, even the gods are bound to walk certain Trails. For a human being to leave the Trails entirely is to endanger their soul, both in the moment and in eternity. Man did so once, and thus so angered the gods, that they caused the Fall to come upon the Earth."
